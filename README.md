# Assignment_2

## NOTE: This has been tested on codelite platform only! Also, c++11 has been used for development.

### Few sub-notes:
* Doxygen documentation can be viewed by cloning the repo and navigating to `documentation/docs/html` and open `index.html` in your local browser.
* Every input being asked contains two values: First being row number, second being column number.
* The grid is designed such that (0, 0) is top-left corner of the map. row and column indices increase downwards (row) and towards right (column).
* Code is designed to accept both ( ) i.e. freespace and (.) i.e. dot as input from map. However, obstacle has to be (#).

## Execution Note!
### Please change the following and run the code.
* line #150 in `main.cpp` where `std::string path` has been defined. Change the value to path in your system before executing the code.
